A million (1,000,000), a billion (1,000,000,000), a trillion (1,000,000,000,000)

They don't seem to be very far apart, don't they? The difference between the numbers are just a mere 3 0's, surely it's as simple as that.

Well……not quite.

Let's say that those numbers are the number of homework you have (scary, ain't it?). Let's start with a million. If you were to finish your homework at a rough steady pace of 4 homework per day, you would be able to finish them in 684 years, 11 months and 6 days.

Great! That isn't too bad right? Surely completing a billion of them would also be somewhere near that figure? Well, let's see. 

With the steady 4 homework per day, we would be able to finish a billion homework in a mere 684 MILLENNIUMS (a unit of 1,000 years!), 931 years, 6 months and 4 days! If in 30 years you handed your homework down to your children then another 30 then they pass to their children onwards, your homework would be completed by your great (times 22,829!) grandchild when he’s 2 years old (If he’s smart enough to do it, of course)! You can now see the vast difference between the numbers, and how mere 0s can change the value of a number by a lot.

To put it in actual real life perspective, it would take light about 1/300-th of a second to cover 1,000,000 km while taking about 3 and ⅓ seconds to cover a billion, which is a time difference of 3.33 seconds which is 99.9% of the time taken to cover a billion km.

It's not your fault if you thought they were seemingly close. Our human mind is sort of programmed in a way that we perceive numbers logarithmic-ally, base-10 to be exact, so a difference of a few 0s doesn't mean much to us. 

But what does logarithmic-ally mean exactly? We’ll come back to it in a second.

Now, if you thought logarithmic perception was the only thing we had, then you are in for a treat. Not only do we perceive big numbers as near each other, we can perceive big numbers as being small as well (or very small numbers as not very small as well), all thanks to indices.

Ever felt it was a hassle whenever you did Maths and came across lengthy equations [change to expression?] like 2×2×2×2×2×2 and felt [that] it was stupid? Surely there must be a way to shorten it? And there is. An index, indices for plural, of a number is how many times you multiply a number by itself. So for the example above, it would be represented as 26 (or 2^6 when typing) as 2 is multiplied by itself 6 times. You can now see that numbers such as 74 aren’t as small as it seems. 74 is 7×7×7×7 which is 2401! This is because we are used to interpreting small numbers as still being small if it isn’t connected together, so 35 is big but 3 and 5, not quite. 

So let us look at an example where indices makes us perceive a very large (or small) number as not being that large (or small) as it should be: Randomly doing a test.

Ever done a multiple-choice exam before, and answered a question randomly because you didn’t know what the answer was? If you have (I’m sure everyone has), then you would have also thought that there was a decent chance of getting those questions correct. You would have thought: Well there’s 4 choices for each question, so I have a 25% chance of getting them correct, right? True, you have 4 choices per question, so its a ¼ [1 in 4] chance or 25% chance of getting it correct. Except, reality is more cruel than you’d think when it comes to probability. The chances of you getting it ALL correct randomly are actually slim.

But how slim?

Well, first we got to understand how probabilities work. Ever seen the Doctor Strange scene/meme from Avengers: Infinity War? In that scene[,] Strange sees 14,000,605 futures, with only 1 of them where they manage to beat Thanos. Probability is something like that. Probability is calculating the chance of you being able to get to an event you wish, say being able to flip a head 10 times in a row, or draw the same card from a deck 20 times. Whenever an action is being done it splits into multiple different ‘timelines’ where you will only manage to come unto 1 when you see the result. 

What about events happening one after another? Let’s look at the flipping coin example above. Every time you flip a coin, it splits into 2 possible scenarios: Head (H) or Tail (T). So there is a 50-50 chance of getting it.  When you flip the coin again, each of the scenarios split into 2 further scenarios of Head or Tail. Now you have a total of 4 (22) possible scenarios: HH, HT, TH, TT (Figure 1). Third flip and each splits into a further 2 with a total of 8 (23) and so on.

<center> Figure 1: Possible Scenarios of 2 flips of a coin, read from left to right, top to bottom (HH, HT, TH, TT) </center>
\
As you can see, with each flip each possibility branches out into 2 further scenarios, with the total increasing by multiplying by 2 each time (2, 4, 8, 16, …). Conversely, each scenario becomes less likely to happen (½, ¼, ⅛, 1/16, …). Now we can look back at our randomly done test. 

Let’s say the test has a standard 30 questions, each with 4 choices to pick from (A, B, C and D). So if you were to do the test randomly, everytime you picked an answer there are 4 possible futures that could appear from it. So the first question would create 4, each where one of the options is correct. The next question furthers splits each branch into 4, creating a total of 4×4=16 different endings. So by the time you randomly finished your test (likely to be very fast), you would have created 430 different futures! With only one of them where you get all the questions correct!!! But how probable is that? Well the probability is 1 out of 430. It LOOKS small and likely doesn’t it? But let me show you some scenarios which will show you how big 430 is. 

Let’s say you did a test per minute (which is very probable, since it’s done randomly). It will take you about 2,193,534,065 MILLENNIUMS to even have a remote chance of acing the test ONCE. To give you a bit of perspective, the universe is 13.772 BILLION years old (give or take 59 million years), which is equal to 13,772,000 MILLENIUM years old, not even 1% of the time you need to have a chance of acing the test. This means that even if you started when the universe was born, your chances of even acing it today (or probably ever) is less than 1%!!!

Ok, maybe I’m being a bit harsh. How about we use a computer to do the random test instead? Let’s say the computer can go at an alarming rate of a MILLION tests per SECOND!!! How probable is it now? Well good news, it will only take the computer about 36,558 years, 10 months, 25 days, 21 hours, 30 minutes and 7 seconds to ace at least 1!!! Hope your computer’s battery doesn’t die out by then! Well we can learn two lessons from this: One is that numbers aren’t as big or small as they seem to be, and another is that study hard and don’t try your luck for your exams, most of the time the chances [odds] are against you.

[If you were to get the whole population of Earth to randomly do that test with you (which is about 7.53 billion people) and followed the 1 test per minute rate, it will still take the whole earth 291 years, 3 months, 20 days, 19 hours and 49.9 seconds to ace one!!! You are even more likely to win the first prize of Singapore 4D (1 in 10,000) and the jackpot for the American lottery (1 in 13,983,816) TOGETHER (1 in 139,838,160,000) than to randomly ace a multiple-choice test ONCE.]

Now back to logarithms (Remember it from the start of the article?). Logarithm, or Log for short, is the opposite of n-roots. Whenever you want to find the length of a square and you have the area, you would have square root the area. Why is that? Well, the area of a square is defined by its length multiplied by itself. So if it’s length is x, its area is x2 (mostly read as x-squared). Root functions, say the square root, helps you find back your x value by applying a fractional index on the number. What does this mean? Let’s look at the square root. Commonly denoted by  , the square root function can also be denoted by ^½, Such that when it square roots a number it actually halves the index of the number, giving you the base number. As an example say you have a square area of 25, the length of said square would be 25=52=(52)1/2=52(1/2)=51=5. So, the cube root of a number would multiply the index of that number by ⅓ to get the base number and so on. Log is the reverse of roots. Rather than giving you the base number a of a number x which is of the form a^n, log gives you the index n of a number x in base x [the log of a number x in base a (or log_a x) tells you how many times a is multiplied by itself to give x.]. Sounds confusing? Well, I’ll explain.


Let’s look at the number 16. The number 16 can be rewritten in index notation as 42 or 24 (since 4=22 so 42=(22)2=22×2=24). Since a base number of 16 is 4 with index power 2, the log of 16 in base 4 is 2, or written as log4(16)=log4(42)=2 . So looking back, way back to the start of a million, billion and trillion, we can now clearly understand why those numbers don’t seem as far apart as they are. A million, billion and trillion can be written as 106, 109 and 1012 respectively (powers of 10 are easy to find, just count the number of 0s the number has, that’s the index of the number with base number 10). So the log of these numbers in base 10 are 6, 9 and 12: Which are just the first few multiples of 3. Now you can see why our brains think the difference between large numbers aren’t that large as it should: Our brain sees the difference not by its actual difference, but rather by the difference in the number of digits. Thanks for reading.
